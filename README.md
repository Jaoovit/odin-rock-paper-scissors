Pseudocode

1º - Create a HTML document with a script tag
2º - Create a way to computer play the game using the function getComputerChoice
3º - Create a function to play a round of the game with two parameters (playerSelection and computerSelection) showing a message like: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
4º - Make the player function case-insensitive to incrise the user experience, the play can write (rock, ROCK, Rock etc.)
5º - In another function create a score sistem and report the winner or loser at the end.


In this project I can apply solve problems skills, using a pseudocode I can organize my ideas and break a problem in small chunks, to create a rock-paper-scissors game, I use a prompt with case-insensitive to get a user choice (rock, paper or scissors) and a Math.Random method to get a computer choice (rock, paper or scissors). I create a function with two constants playerSelection() with the user choice and computerSelection() with the computer choice, and I used the information to create a logic sistem to informe the game winner.

.Create functions
.Create constants
.Use logic to define the game winner
.Use Math.Random method to ask a random number to computer
.Use the function information in another functions
